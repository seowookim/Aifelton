### Purpose

The purpose of this work is to understand what is cognitive distortion by sorting out cognitive distortion sentences from texts using Streamlit. 

### Results

- When three people manually reviewed the data, it became evident that even humans find it challenging to detect and classify cognitive distortions.
- However, we observed that accuracy tends to improve over time.
